# hello-world
Hello, world! I'm learning to use GitHub.

I have signed up to Maker's Academy and am in my second week of offsite (pre-onsite) training. I've decided to get more familiar with GitHub by doing their 'Hello World' intro guide. Honestly, right now I'm feeling a little lost. I'm pretty sure this will become more familiar and make more sense over time though!
